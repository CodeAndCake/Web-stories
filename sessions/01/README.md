But what is the **purpose**?

Coding for coding's sake has little purpose.

### Code as a means, not an end

Code can be a **tool** in your creative toolbox.

*With* code, you can make things for people. Like games and stories. 

Today, we are going to start designing and making **interactive stories**.

We will use a tool called [Twine](../../twine) to **code** your interactive stories and publish them on the Web.

We will show you a few **coding tricks** and we'll lay the **foundations** of your stories together.
