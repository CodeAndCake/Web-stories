# Web stories day 1

### Today, Tuesday 26th of January

1. [What is this workshop about](#hands-up-if-you)?
* [What is a story](#what-is-a-story)?
* [What makes a story](#what-makes-a-story)?
* [How does a story unfold](#how-does-a-story-unfold)? 
* [Story lines](#story-lines)
* [Non-linear stories](#non-linear-stories)
* [Story-mapping](#story-mapping)


# Hands up if you...

### ...*read* a **story** before today?

What stories do you like reading?

### ...*told* a **story** before today?

What was the last story you told? 

How do people experience your stories?

### ...*played* a **game** before today?

What games do you like playing?

### ...*made* a **game** before today?

Ever changed the rules of a game you play, even slightly? 

Ever asked someone a question that quizzed them, or puzzled them? That's a game too.

### ...*wrote* any **code** before today? 

You probably heard that you **should learn** to code, right?

But what is the **purpose**?

Coding for coding's sake has little purpose.

### Code as a means, not an end

Code can be a **tool** in your creative toolbox.

*With* code, you can make things for people. Like games and stories. 

Today, we are going to start designing and making **interactive stories**.

We will use a tool called [Twine](../../twine) to **code** your interactive stories and publish them on the Web.

We will show you a few **coding tricks** and lay the foundations of **your stories** together. 


# What is a story?

> An **account** of an event or a **series of events**, either true or fictitious.

> Definition from the [Free Dictionary ](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/story) 

...or

> A story is a promise that the end is **worth waiting for**.

> [Mallary Jean Tenore](http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/writing/200728/theres-no-such-thing-as-first-person-omniscient-when-writing-a-personal-story)

### What makes a story?

**Compare**:

#### 	Is *this* a story?

> A `blog` is a personal journal published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete entries known as `posts`, typically displayed in reverse chronological order to the most recent post appears first. Blogs are usually the work of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often themed on a single subject.

#### 	Is *this* a story?

> Meet Danny. She recently created a website where she posts information about her experiences raising a puppy. Her website is an online journal, or `blog`, where she posts a new entry that appears at the top of her page every few days. This stream of entries has enabled her to connect with dog lovers from around the world.

#### 	Is *this* a story?

> In 2006 David Maister, an expert in professional service firms, started his `blog`. A blog is like an online journal. David would share his thoughts day-by-day, with his latest ideas appearing at the top of the page. He also encouraged his readers, like me, to leave comments.

> As I was just starting my business I thought I would email David seeking his help. He called me from Boston the next day and to my surprise he said he would waive his high fees because he now thought of me as a friend after reading my online comments on his blog.

The examples above are adapted from [Fact telling vs story telling](http://www.anecdote.com/2013/01/fact-telling-versus-story-telling/).

* All three texts **convey facts**, explaining us what a `blog` is and how it works.  
 
* The first text is **not a story**.   

* The second and third texts **are stories**.

* The third text is a better story because it harnesses **feelings**.

#### Your turn

In pairs, pick an object in this room and write a short story (max 2 paragraphs) to explain it.

15 minutes.

<!-- 

Exercise (option 2): in pairs, tell the story of something interesting that happened to your team mate in the last week

-->

#### Story ingredients

1. **Time** or **place** marker
* Things happening (ie **events**) 
* Something **unexpected**

The third point is what can turn a story into a great story.

[How to tell a great story](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/04/ode_how_to_tell.html) by Seth Godin.

### How does a story unfold?

![](../../assets/freytags-pyramid.jpg)

[Gustav Freytag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Freytag) divided stories into five **acts**: 

1. Exposition
* Rising action
* Climax
* Falling action (or final suspense and resolution)
* DÃ©nouement (conclusion)

This dramatic structure is known as the [Freytag's pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure#Freytag.27s_analysis).

It has been used for thousands of years across the world to tell epic tales of heroes overcoming huge challenges. See [monomyth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth)

However, many people argue that not all stories need a challenged hero. In fact, most stories are not about heroic events, but rather *coincidences*. That is, **something unexpected**.

#### Not just `Once upon a time`

What else you can use a story for? 

* A **resume** that tells the story of you
* A **portfolio** that tells the story of your work
* A **case study** that tells the story of your project
* A **storyboard** that presents your research
* A story that illustrates a **poem**
* A story that lets you **explore a space**, like [this](http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/centuryofthechild/#/timeline/power-play)
* A story that raises awareness about an issue and invites people to take action, like [this](http://buntspenden.bleech.de/en/)

# Story lines

[![](../../assets/queue.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hktang/4243300265)

Let's make a collective story. 

1. Line people up on one side of the room. 
2. On the other side is the *story line*. 
3. One person at a time walks to the *story line* and adds their bit to the story.     

	The first two people must either choose the beginning (eg: *Once upon a time...*) or the end of the story (eg: *...and since then, everyone revered her*).  
   
	Everyone can add their bit in between the beginning and the end. 
4. Every time someone joins the *story line*, the story loops from the beginning.


# Non-linear stories

Even though the *story lines* we created were **linear** we could see how at every turn the story could change, taking a completely different path.

Whilst playing [*Story lines*](#story-lines) your mind was probably buzzing with **what if** questions.

One of the powers of **code** is to enable **non-linear storytelling**. You can play out all your *what-ifs*. 

In fact `if this then that` is a major coding principle. Algorithms at their core are made up of lots of `if this then that` blocks.

Let's start thinking about stories like **maps of events**. 

[![](../../assets/should-you-work-for-free.jpg)](http://www.shouldiworkforfree.com/)

Our job as **storytellers** is to join the dots, and guide our listeners/readers/players through various paths.


# Story-mapping

Form teams of 2, aka pairs.

Come up with at least **2 story ideas**.

* Think about your story as a **map**. 
* Jot down all the *points* in your story and then start *linking* them.
* Remember: it's about **choices**. 
* Make sure there are several paths, not just a single line.

They can be your own ideas, remixes of existing stories, or if you're stuck you can take inspiration from these story starters:

1. Remix a fairy tale.
* Turn a videogame into a story.
* It's 2020 and it's very warm, globally.
* A conversation going wrong.
* A cow's life.
* Pick a story from the news and re-invent it. Or tell it from a different moral perspective.
* Story of a migrant.
* Superhero not so super.
* What if David Cameron was an alien?
* You wake up in a deserted Ravensbourne after the apocalypse.
