### As it's told

One cold January evening
the Falafel
fresh
homemade
that the girl held
tightly
who was rushing for the toilet and
was watching Kim Kardashian's sextape
stolen from her grandmother
who made copies of it
and gave it to everybody at the book club
and Kanye made a song out of
which made it to the top 10
then Kim made her own
which made her a Boss-a$$ Bitch
and since then, everyone revered her

### As it's told

Once upon a time
far far away
Donald Trump's hair was revealed to be an exotic bird
Barack Obama said it is
a nuclear bomb
of some sort
and then Hillary Clinton picked up the phone
called a strip club
and said
"Has anyone got any sweets?"
And then she said "Jamaican me crazy"
And he said "That's what I do"
And she said "I need to use my phone"
But I have no credit left
You can't use my phone
Donald Trump flew in
and transformed his hair into a phone
And boy, did he make money out of it!
It was a different time then
