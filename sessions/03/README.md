### What are we doing today?

We think we have a better idea of where you are right now. You are putting together your portfolios and in the next few days / weeks many of you have interviews.

So the aims of today are:

* Organise your work to **tell the story** of your projects
* Start building an **online one-page portfolio** for your work
* Learn **HTML & CSS**
* **Publish and host** your portfolio online

Bringing storytelling and coding together to make something that is useful to you, today.
