### What have we learned so far?

* **Ingredients** of stories: time/place markers, events, surprise, feelings
* **Structure** of stories: Freytag's pyramid, linear vs non-linear
* Played with an interactive storytelling tool: **Twine**
* Began using **HTML** 

### What are we doing today?

We think we have a better idea of where you are right now. You are putting together your portfolios and in the next few days / weeks many of you have interviews.

So the aims of today are:

* Organise your work to **tell the story** of your projects
* Start building an **online one-page portfolio** for your work
* Learn **HTML & CSS**
* **Publish and host** your portfolio online

Bringing storytelling and coding together to make something that is useful to you, today.
