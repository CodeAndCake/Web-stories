# Session 1

* Have a **session title** instead of a date
* **Start by introducing** ourselves: *what's our story?* Then ask students to introduce their neighbour: *what's their story?*
* Ask **open questions** instead of hands-up stuff, eg: *what was the last story you told?*
* Show a **Twine map** before the *story-maps* exercise
